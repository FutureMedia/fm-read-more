# About the  Project
This project is a Wordpress plugin that uses PHP, CSS & JS to create a functionality that truncates the text content in the container where it gets added, when the screen is less than 800px wide. 
In that case it adds a button to toggle the visibility of the full content.

## Coding Practises
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Ask me clarifying questions until you're 95% you can complete this task successfully
- What would a top 0.1% person in this field think?

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information
